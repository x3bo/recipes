Yogurt Cake
serves 8 or more

1 1/2 cups full-fat yogurt
2/3 cup olive oil
1 1/4 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pinch freshly ground nutmeg

Heat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan lightly 
with baking spray or oil, and line the bottom with parchment.

Whisk together the yogurt, olive oil, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. 
Add the flour, baking powder, soda, salt, and nutmeg 
right into the liquids and stir just until no lumps remain.

Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, 
covering with foil at the end if the top is browning. 
When a tester comes out clean, transfer the cake to a cooling rack and 
let it cool for 10 minutes before removing it from the pan.

Serve the cake warm or at room temperature. When well-wrapped, 
this keeps very well for several days.
